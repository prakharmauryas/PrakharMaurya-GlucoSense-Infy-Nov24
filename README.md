# GlucoSense: AI-Powered Diabetes Detection System

## üìã Project Overview  
This project focuses on building an advanced machine learning system for predicting diabetes based on key symptoms and demographic factors. Diabetes, a chronic and potentially life-threatening condition, can be effectively managed and its complications mitigated through early detection. By leveraging healthcare data, we aim to create an accurate and reliable classification model to support timely diagnosis and intervention.  

## üéØ Objectives  
- Perform detailed analysis of diabetes patterns and risk factors.  
- Identify individuals at high risk of diabetes using symptom data.  
- Develop a machine learning model with high predictive accuracy.  
- Pinpoint significant symptoms contributing to diabetes diagnosis.  
- Offer a user-friendly platform with diabetes-related information, including prevention tips, wellness advice, and medication insights.  
- Evaluate the model using robust metrics such as ROC curves, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## üìä Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Symptoms Analysis:** Polyuria and Polydipsia emerged as the most significant predictors of diabetes.  
- **Demographic Patterns:**  
  - Males aged 40‚Äì60 and females aged 30‚Äì60 exhibit higher diabetes prevalence.  
  - Correlation analysis highlighted a strong link between Polyuria and Polydipsia, while symptoms like Weakness had a weaker correlation with diabetes.  
- **Feature Interactions:** Certain symptoms often co-occur, providing valuable patterns for prediction.  

## üìÇ Dataset Features  
The dataset comprises 16 features including demographic details and symptoms:  
- **Demographic:** Age, Gender  
- **Symptoms:** Polyuria, Polydipsia, Sudden weight loss, Weakness, Polyphagia, Genital Thrush, Visual blurring, Itching, Irritability, Delayed healing, Partial Paresis, Muscle stiffness, Alopecia, Obesity  
- **Target Class:** Positive/Negative (indicating the presence of diabetes)  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Tools Used  
- **Languages & IDEs:** Python (3.x), Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing  
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
  - Scikit-learn for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning  

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure the following tools are installed:  
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  

### Installation Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/example/GlucoSense-Project.git  
   cd GlucoSense-Project  
   ```  
2. Create a virtual environment (optional):  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`  
   ```  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

### Usage  
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook  
   ```  
2. Open `diabetes_detection.ipynb` to explore the data analysis, visualization, and model development process.  

## üìà Models and Evaluation  
The following machine learning algorithms were explored:  
- **Baseline:** Logistic Regression  
- **Advanced Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- **Metrics for Evaluation:**  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - ROC-AUC for comparing model performance  

The best-performing model was selected based on its balanced performance across these metrics.  

## üìù Future Enhancements  
- Perform hyperparameter optimization for improved accuracy.  
- Explore advanced models like Neural Networks.  
- Deploy the best-performing model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.  
- Extend the dataset to include more diverse demographic and health factors for generalizability.
